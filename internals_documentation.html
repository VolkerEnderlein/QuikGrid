<h2><a name="mozTocId478644"></a><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font
 size="5"><b>Introduction</b></font></font></h2>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">I initially wrote QuikGrid as
an exercise to learn C++ programming under Windows. It was
implemented and has been maintained using Borland C++ compilers, most
recently version 5.0B (1996). My primary source of information for
the Windows programming environment (API) has been from the books
published by Petzold. My use of classes is primarily to simplify
memory management. The code does not make use of any Windows Object
Oriented classes like the MS MFC or Borland's OWL.&nbsp; QuikGrid
consists of approximately 37 separate source (.cpp) files with
associated .h files, etc. Originally the program was called “Surface”
and you will occasionally find references to surface in the code
(e.g. surface.ico is the icon for QuikGrid). </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The programming style varies
as I have been learning C++ as I go along. My many years of
experience with the FORTRAN language shows through. (The contouring
and grid expansion routines are originally translations of FORTRAN
code.) Also I tended to experiment with different techniques as I
developed the code. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The contouring and grid
expansion routines have been distributed as free software under the
GNU Lesser GPL license. They are available from my web site
</font><a href="http://www.perspectiveedge.com/"><font
 face="Times New Roman, serif">www.perspectiveedge.com</font></a>
<font face="Times New Roman, serif">. That is the more appropriate
source code to download if you are only interested in one of those
routines. The code has been compiled and tested under Linux and I have
a report that it compiles under MS VC.&nbsp; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><b>quikgrid.cpp</b> implements
<b>Winmain</b>. The <b>dialog boxes</b> are implemented in
<b>dialogbx.cpp</b> and files named <b>dlg*.cpp</b>. The routine
<b>paintcon.cpp</b> is the core code for all drawing (think of “paint
contours”, which is all it did originally). The core code for
data input is in <b>loaddata.cpp</b>. Data output tends to be handled
by a host of different files, for example, <b>vrml.cpp</b> for vrml
output, <b>datawrit.cpp</b> to output scattered data points,
<b>dxfwrite.cpp</b> to output DXF files, etc. Command files are all
handled in <b>cmdfile.cpp</b>. The saving and restoring of
preferences is all in <b>prefer.cpp</b>. There are lots of little
support routines implemented in files like <b>utilitys.cpp</b> and
<b>grid.cpp</b>. If I can't remember where a function is implemented
I usually find it by doing a “grep” like search on the
source files. </font>
</p>
<h2><a name="mozTocId971997"></a><font face="Times New Roman, serif">QuikGrid
(Winmain) </font>
</h2>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">At startup WM_CREATE&nbsp; does
initializations then posts an IDM_STARTUP message. IDM_STARTUP
checks to see if there are any command line arguments. This will
happen if QuikGrid is invoked from a DOS command of the form
“<b>QuikGrid input.* output.*</b>” or is linked to from
another program using such a command. This is also what it looks like
to QuikGrid if a data file is “dragged and dropped” onto
the QuikGrid Icon or if a file association is made between some file
types and QuikGrid and a user double clicks on the data file. . </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">If there are no command line
arguments QuikGrid goes into a normal Windows wait state. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">If a command line argument is
present QuikGrid assumes the argument is a file name and processes
the file as if a person had started QuikGrid and then selected an
“File... Input scattered data points...” or File...
Process command file” menu operation. Which command is
determined from the file Suffix as described in the documentation.
Similarly if there is a second argument it is assumed to be a file
name and QuikGrid generates a grid and does an appropriate output
command. If a second argument is present QuikGrid then terminates. If
only one argument is present it processes the input file, generates a
grid if it was not a command file, then goes into a normal Windows
wait state. </font>
</p>
<h2><a name="mozTocId176172"></a><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font
 size="5">Loaddata</font></font></h2>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The storage of the input data
is handled by the class <b>scatdata.cpp</b> . Speed of access to the
x, y and z data points is one of the critical areas with respect to
CPU usage. The points are stored as three arrays x[], y[] and z[],
each of which is one block of contiguous memory. Other storage
schemes seem to produce higher overhead. Initially the code allocates
enough space for 16,000 data points. If it runs out it allocates new
space which is 2.5 times bigger, copies the data over to the new
space and releases the old. This will be repeated as often as
necessary until all the data points are stored. The upper limit of
128 million is just a sanity check. It also maintains an array of
pointers to optional comments attached to a data point and an array
of type char which is used to store flags (Of which only one is used
- namely the flag that says this data point should be ignored during
grid generation). </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The Scatdata class keeps track
of the max and mins for x, y and z. It also maintains a value called
<b>zadjust</b> which is used to asure that all the z coordinates are
positive. Negative values are used to flag unevaluated grid
intersections throughout the program.&nbsp; The x and y values are
normalized by subtracting the x,y value of the first data point from
all data points. The normalization values are stored as <b>dxnormalize</b>
and <b>dynormalize</b>. They may be retrieved using the function
<b>LoadNormalization</b>. This allows all the computations to proceed
using single precision arithmetic. Any time an internal value is to
be displayed it must be modified by zadjust, dxnormalize or
dynormalize. Similarly numbers entered in a dialog box must also be
modified appropriately. This was not implemented very neatly and I
have never taken the time to clean it up. Be careful - it is a
constant source of error - although one easily dealt with. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">All the data input are read as
strings and the conversion to floating point is done by QuikGrid, not
by the IO routines. There is a story behind that! Years ago Microsoft
released a version of Microsoft Plus for Windows 95 that broke the
floating point input routines for programs compiled using the Borland
Compiler. (The bug didn't affect MS C++ compiled programs). The fix
was a service pack that was 10 times the size of QuikGrid and I
rebelled at the thought of expecting my customers to have to download
and install a service pack if they were using Microsoft Plus. Rather
than spend money on the Microsoft Compiler (and being more than a
little annoyed at MS) I elected to read the data as strings and
convert them to floating point internally. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The focus of the display is
always the generated grid so LoadData will create an appropriate grid
and initialize it (see function <b>InitializeGrid</b>in<b>grid.cpp</b>).
If a grid has been loaded QuikGrid will create a dummy set of 2
scattered data points which spans the space. (Any set of data points
that contains less than 3 points is considered a “dummy”
set internally, but it will be set so that the max and min's are
appropriate to the grid input so an attempt to display just the data
set in cases like this will not fail). </font>
</p>
<h2><a name="mozTocId521987"></a><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font
 size="5"><b>Paintcon</b></font></font></h2>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">QuikGrid handles a WM_PAINT
call differently depending on whether the program is in 2d or 3d
mode. In either case there are three steps</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">1. Determine the scaling
required for the image (Scale2dRectangle or Scale3dCube). <br>
2.
Centre the image on the screen (CentreDisplay) <br>
3. Paint the
screen (Paint2dSurface, Paint3dSurface). </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">All those entry points are in
Paintcon. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">QuikGrid runs in mapmode
MM_ISOTROPIC. The data is scaled to fit into the Windows world of 0
to 32k and all scaling, zooming, panning etc. is handled by changing
the Windows window and viewport (SetWindow* and SetViewport*) and
redrawing the screen. I think of it as “vector” mode as
opposed to a “bitmap” mode. The code only rarely has to
dip down and deal with the world of bits (but it must occasionally to
determine things like line thickness in the Isotropic world –
which is not specified in bits, and so the thickness changes
depending on the amount of zooming that is being done). </font>
</p>
<h3><a name="mozTocId879546"></a><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Scaling
to the Windows World </font>
</h3>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The job of <b>Scale2dRectangle</b>
and <b>Scale3dCube</b> is to determine the maximum and minimum values
for the image and set up the scaling parameters for the inline
functions <b>ScaleX</b> and <b>ScaleY</b> (and <b>UnScaleX</b> and
<b>UnScaleY</b> – their inverse). Those inline functions map
the data from the QuikGrid floating point world into the Windows
integer Isotropic world.</font> <font face="Times New Roman, serif">This
is a trivial exercise for Scale2dRectangle.</font> <font
 face="Times New Roman, serif">The
scaling is always determined by the grid, not the scattered data
points, which is why a grid must always be present, even if only the
scattered data points are to be displayed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Things are a little more
complex in the 3d world. Scale3dCube rotates the extremes of the 3d
cube to determine the maximum extents of the rotated 2d image. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The value <b>Margin</b>
controls the white space at the edge of the image. <b>MaxScale</b> is
a constant set so that the image can nicely be both zoomed and
unzoomed (set MaxScale too high and the image can only be zoomed in
on). Once this is set up all you have to do is remember to scale
everything via ScaleX or ScaleY before handing them to any Windows
drawing function. </font>
</p>
<h3><a name="mozTocId294962"></a><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Centering
and zooming the display</font></h3>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The idea here is that the
image is probably being redrawn because the user has clicked
somewhere in the image, indicating it should be redrawn,
zoomed/unzoomed/panned with the mouse location to be the centre of
the new image. <b>CentreDisplay</b> handles the calculation of the
new Window and Viewport. By the time CentreDisplay is called the
zooming and panning information has already been handled via Paintcon
functions like <b>ZoomViewDouble</b>,<b>ZoomIn</b>,<b>ZoomOut</b> and
<b>PanView</b>.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">For example, when the user
left clicks the mouse, case WM_LBUTTONDOWN is invoked in
quikgrid.cpp. It sets the mapmode to MM_ISOTROPIC, determines the
position of the mouse, converts it to the Windows Isotropic world,
then calls ZoomViewDouble, which updates the QuikGrid internal
parameters for the desired Window. It then invalidates the current
display (done by function <b>PictureChanged</b>) which triggers the
WM_PAINT call to redraw the screen. WM_PAINT calls Scale2dRectangle
(or Scale3dCube) then calls CentreDisplay to set up the viewport and
window, then finally calls Paint2dSurface or Paint3dSurface to do the
actual drawing. For the most part you can ignore the fact that
scaling and zooming is being done while you work in the
Paint2dRectangle or Paint3dCube code. </font>
</p>
<h3><a name="mozTocId726096"></a><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Painting
the display.</font></h3>
<p>There is a lot of code in Paintcon that is soley there to reduce
the time taken to paint the image. The code would be a fraction of
it's current size and much simpler to follow if the code just painted
the image in a straightforward fashion. <br>
</p>
<p>I reduce the time taken to
display the image in two main ways. <br>
</p>
<p>First the code attempts to remove lines and features which are not
visible, i.e. not within the viewing window. The functions <b>Visible,
VisibleX, VisibleY</b> and <b>InTheGrid </b>in paintcon.cpp are used
for this. For example the routine that displays the 3d hidden grid, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Hatch3d (in hatch.cpp)</span>, calls these
routines to determine if a grid rectangle is in the viewing window and
doesn't draw it if it is not eligible to be viewed. <br>
</p>
<p>Secondly the code assembles contiguous line segments into Windows
polylines (See the code in <span style="font-weight: bold;">drawstuff</span>.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">cpp </span>in particular function
<b>PlotTo</b>). <br>
</p>
<p>These two mechanisms greatly
reduce the number of calls across the Operating System Interface and
reduce the time taken to draw an image, especially when a lot of
zooming is going
on. <br>
</p>
<p>In other situations I pre-compute scaled and rotated values and
save them for later use. </p>
<h4><a name="mozTocId21805"></a><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Paint2dRectangle</font></h4>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Life is relatively easy in the
2d world. You can take any QuikGrid x,y position, scale it with
ScaleX and ScaleY and pass it to a Windows drawing API function like
<b>LineTo </b>or <b>MoveToExt </b>and it will work fine. However
most
of the routines <span style="text-decoration: underline;">do not</span>
make heavy use of those functions. Instead
they call internal QuikGrid functions like <b>PlotTo </b>and
<b>PolyBuffer </b>which are defined in the module <b>drawstuf.cpp</b>.
</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><b>PlotTo</b> removes line
segments that are not within the viewed window (i.e. Visible). It does
not attempt to do any clipping though. If the line pierces the window
or potentially passes through it the line is handed to Windows to clip.
This
decreases the time it takes to display the image, especially if any
zooming is going on. The calling sequence is PlotTo(x,y,pen) where
x,y are the scaled x,y coordinates and pen is zero for a move and 1
or 2 for a draw. A pen of 1 selects a normal black line and a pen of
2 selects a bold line. A negative pen value tells PlotTo to flush the
polyline buffer.&nbsp; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><b>Polybuffer</b> assembles
individual line segments together into Windows “polylines”.
Polybuffer(x,y,draw) is primarily called by PlotTo. The arguments are
the scaled x,y coordinates and draw is 0 for a move or 1 for a draw
(PlotTo selects the bold face pen before calling PolyBuffer when a
bold line is required). A negative draw tells PolyBuffer to flush the
polyline buffer. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><b>Drawing the grid</b>: In an
ideal world a grid line could be draw straight across from min to max
in one draw. But we have undefined grid intersections that can force
a blank segment into the line at any time. Function <b>Draw2dGridline</b>
takes care of this complexity for non-coloured grid squares. Function
<b>Hatch2d</b> from <b>hatch.cpp</b> is used to paint coloured grids.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><b>Contour lines: </b>Black
and bold contour lines are only computed the first time they are
defined for a given image. The generated and scaled line coordinates
are saved in <b>Save2dContours</b> which is defined by the class
<b>SaveLineType</b>. If the user zooms in on an image the precomputed
and scaled coordinates are retrieved and passed on quite rapidly. 3d
contour lines are handled similarly using <b>Save3dContours</b>.&nbsp;</font>
</p>
<h4><a name="mozTocId517667"></a><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Paint3dCube</font></h4>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">In the 3d world a lot more has
to be kept in mind. </font>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The points all have to be
rotated and optionally a perspective projection applied.<br>
The rotation math is all in <b>rotate.cpp</b> . When the viewer
changes the angle of view <b>RotateInitialize</b> is called to set the
rotation matrix constants. Thereafter any set of x,y,z coordinates can
be rotated by calling the function <b>rotate</b>. Perspective
projection is handled separately by function <b>Project</b>.
Separating out the perspective projection saves cpu time if an
orthographic projection only is wanted. (This was important in the
early days).&nbsp; </font> </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Typically the z-axis is
scaled to be some fraction of the size of the x-axis (see <b>zratio</b>
in the documentation) <br>
The grid is stored in <b>Zgrid</b> which is defined by the class <b>SurfaceGrid</b>.
The implementation of this class is in <b>surfgrid.cpp</b>. The
application of the <b>zratio</b> is done within the class. The scaling
of the z grid coordinate is initially done by Scale3dCube through the
function <b>ApplyzRatio</b>. Depending on what is going on the zratio
scaling may be turned off for some computations, for example to obtain
the true value of a grid coordinate to determine the colour of the grid
square. (There is some real messy code in this area).&nbsp; </font> </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Hidden line removal is
achieved by drawing stuff the farthest away from the viewer first.<br>
I believe this is called "the poor mans hidden surface algorithm". The
code draws the xy axes first, and the z axis first or last depending on
the angle of the view. The grid surface is drawn from the back to the
front. This logic is all handled by function <b>Hatch3d </b>in <b>hatch.cpp</b>.
Scattered data points and the outline are displayed last and are never
hidden. If hidden contour lines are desired (the default) they are
generated on a grid by grid basis by Hatch3d (which is slow!). Non
hidden contour lines are rendered by CNTOUR in the same fashion as the
2d case. Non hidden contour lines draw very fast as polylines are
generated. Labels can be applied if the 3d contour lines
are not hidden. </font> </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>The entire grid is rotated, scaled and stored in the variable
<b>xyGrid</b> early on in the procedure using the Paintcon function
<b>RotateGrid</b>. xyGrid is defined by the class <b>xyGridClass</b>which
is located in <b>xygrid.cpp</b> . </p>
<h4><a name="mozTocId83848"></a><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Grid
Resolution </font>
</h4>
<p>QuikGrid can display every nth grid line (which I call grid
resolution) or a section of a grid. This can greatly speed up the
viewing of a large grid. This is a relatively recent innovation and
so far I have only made use of the grid resolution feature. The nitty
gritty is in the class <b>SurfaceGrid </b>and also in the module
<b>gridres.cpp</b>.</p>
<h2><a name="mozTocId727184"></a>Xpand (Grid generation)</h2>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Source files: XPAND.CPP,
XPAND.H<br>
void Xpand( SurfaceGrid &amp;Zgrid, ScatData &amp;RandomData)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Undefined grid intersections
are flagged, by default, as -99999. QuikGrid adjusts the z
coordinates so they are always positive and then corrects the values
for display purposes. Contour makes use of this convention as well
and does not contour negative areas of the grid.</font></p>
<h3><a name="mozTocId515382"></a>Xpand Algorithm</h3>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">XPAND is basically a Nearest
Neighbour algorithm with eight sectors. The algorithm lends itself to
an efficient implementation, which is why XPAND is fast.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Xpand is organized so that
each grid intersection can be evaluated in a separate function call.
This feature was included to allow a grid to be evaluated in the
background under Windows 3.1. Under Windows 3.1 timesharing only
worked if each program voluntarily relinquished control back to the
OS after a small time period. With Xpand this was accomplished by
only computing one Grid Intersection at a time. The functions
involved include XpandInit - to initialize everything and XpandPoint,
which evaluated one grid intersection only. It is very unlikely that
these functions have any external use any more. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Routine <b>Xpand</b> calls
<b>XpandInit</b> to set everything up and then calls <b>XpandPoint</b>
for each grid intersection until the grid is evaluated.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Initialization is handled by
the functions <b>XpandInit</b> and <b>LocateInit</b>. <b>XpandInit</b>
initializes a lot of local variables and then calls LocateInit.
<b>LocateInit</b> makes use of the Class GridXtype which sets up an
array called <b>Locator</b>, which contains all the scattered data
points and associates with each data point the grid intersection it
is closest to. The array is then sorted by grid intersection. It then
creates a lookup table that makes it very fast to find all the data
points that are close to a given grid intersection. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The procedure is then
identical for the calculation of each grid intersection.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">First the closest data points
in each octant are determined. This is done by looking at all the
data points close to the grid intersection to be evaluated and then
scanning the data points for nearby grid intersections by shelling
out from the intersection being evaluated. The process will
eventually stop due to:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">- An edge of the grid is
reached. <br>
- The distance from the grid intersection being
evaluated becomes too large. <br>
- The distance becomes far enough
that any new data points can not contribute appreciably to the
weighted value of the intersection.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Function <b>PutInOctant</b>
keeps track of the closest data point in each octant. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Once the scanning process is
complete the weighted average of the selected points are used to
determine the value for the grid intersection. The grid intersection
may be left unevaluated because there are no points nearby or because
the points are all on one side of the grid intersection. </font>
</p>
<h3><a name="mozTocId750479"></a>Xpand Speed considerations: </h3>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Speed of access to the
scattered data points is the most critical part of the program.
Storing the data points as single dimensioned contiguous memory
arrays for X, Y and Z seemed to produce the best results for me. My
tests showed that storing them as a structure of x,y,z was slower and
storing them as any sort of chained blocks of memory (which I did for
data sets larger than 16000 points under Windows 3.1) was much
slower. All this was done back in the Windows 3.1 days. Perhaps the
compilers are smarter optimizers now? </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The rest of the time critical
code pretty well cascades back from there to the table lookup for
data points close to a given grid intersection (<b>ScanOneGrid</b>)
and the shelling out process (<b>SelectPoints</b>). </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The sorting of the array of
data points and associated grid intersections is another time eater.
Xpand uses the standard Unix math function <b>Qsort</b> for this
purpose. I don't know what has been going on in the world of sorting
these days but back in the 1970's the Quick Sort algorithm was about
as good as you could get and the one provided in the library should
be written in assembler and highly optimized (but maybe not?). </font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Much of this code dates back
to 1993 when I was using a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">25Mhz

<h3><a name="mozTocId845089"></a>Grid Generation Artifacts</h3>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Xpand suffers from the same
artifacts that all grid generation schemes share. For example the
contour lines may not "honour" the scattered data points
(i.e. the contour line may go on the wrong side of the data point -
this is because it is the generated grid being contoured, not the
original data points). </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The algorithm works best with
scattered data points that are more or less evenly distributed. The
most common artifact is typically a "ripple" in the
generated grid that goes at 45 or 90 degree angles. This may become
pronounced if your scattered data points tend to be oriented in rows
or columns. The effect is generated as a column or row of data points
moves from one octant to another as grid intersections are evaluated.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The algorithm is
interpolative, not extrapolative. If you ask it to extrapolate to the
edges when there are no points "out there" the results may
be quite strange (play with the Edge Sensitivity and Distance cutoff
to experiment with this - different data sets will behave in
different ways). </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">If the data points are
clustered, leaving large areas of the grid with no data points
nearby, the grid generation times will suffer. By default these grid
intersections may be left unevaluated but you may over-ride this by
used the Distance cutoff parameter (and increasing the grid
generation time). If the scattered data points are very sparse in
comparison to the grid (a dense grid), grid generation times will
suffer. Basically anything that causes Xpand to shell out a long way
to find data points will cause the grid generation time to suffer. </font>

<h2><a name="mozTocId130163"></a>Contour (Contour line generation)</h2>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Sourcefiles : CONTOUR.CPP,
CONTOUR.H, SWITCH.CPP<br>
void Contour( SurfaceGrid &amp;Zgrid, float
ContourValue )</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Will contour a grid for a
single contour value. Call it repeatedly to contour more than one
contour value. The function void <b>DoLineTo(float x, float y, int
draw)</b>, which is defined in <b>Paintcon</b>, will be called
repeatedly as the contour line is traced. Contour lines which
intercept the edge of the grid are contoured first, then interior
closed contour lines are traced. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">CONTOUR assigns the average of
the four corners of a grid to the centre of the grid and then
contours the 4 triangles. There is only one way a contour line can
traverse a triangle. Because each contour line is traced continuously
from edge to edge or back on itself (in the case of closed contours)
the lines can be “painted” using Windows polylines. </font>

<h2><a name="HelpFile"></a>Help File</h2>
The help facility is maintained using an ancient version of Microsoft
Help Workshop, Version&nbsp; 4.03.0002, 1997. You may have trouble
locating a copy (Try Google for "hcw.exe help workshop". The last time
I downloaded it (April, 2005) it was available in
<a
 href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/office97dev/helpws97/4.03/WIN98/EN-US/Hcwsetup.exe">http://download.microsoft.com/download/office97dev/helpws97/4.03/WIN98/EN-US/Hcwsetup.exe</a>.
I was not able to find it using the Microsoft Search facility on their
site (I did find a reference that noted it was obsolete). I maintained
the
help file using Word 97 or Word 2000. The
concept for this version of Help Workshop is that the document is
maintained as a word document and exported (or saved) as an .rtf file.
The .rtf file is used as input to Help Workshop. Documentation is
included with Help Workshop if you can find a copy. Open Office does
not export an .rtf file that is compatible with Help Workshop. <br>
<br>
Microsoft considers this version of&nbsp; Help Workshop to be obsolete.
The newer version of Help Workshop is HTML based. Probably time to
change to a new program. <br>
